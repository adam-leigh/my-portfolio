title: "Building Neocortexa: My Personal AI for an Intentional Life"
summary: "Neocortexa is my personal life operating system, an agentic AI I'm building to help me live in radical alignment with my deepest values through a gamified, data-driven approach. By monitoring my daily behavior and learning my goals, the system creates a symbiotic feedback loop to close the gap between the person I want to be and the person reflected in my actions."

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by systems. As a software developer, I build them for a living—crafting full-stack applications and AI models that solve specific problems. But the most complex system I've ever had to navigate is my own life. There’s often a gap between the person I aspire to be and the person reflected in my daily actions.

What if I could close that gap? What if I could use my skills to build a system that not only understands my deepest values but actively helps me live in radical alignment with them?

### Introducing Neocortexa

This is the question that led me to create **Neocortexa**.

Neocortexa is more than just a project; it's my personal life operating system. It's an attempt to merge technology with life design, to hijack my own reward and consequence systems, and to gamify the process of becoming the person I want to be. It’s my co-pilot for living an exceptional life, intentionally.

### How It Works: Observation and Feedback

The premise is simple, but the execution is deeply technical. At its core, Neocortexa is an agentic AI system that monitors my behavior, learns what I ultimately want out of life, and engages with me to keep me on track. It sees my browsing history during deep work sessions, integrates with my health data to know how I slept, and listens to my reflections via voice transcripts. It’s an ever-present, objective observer.

But observation without feedback is useless. The real power of Neocortexa lies in its ability to create a feedback loop. It doesn't just passively collect data; it interacts with me. It sends me a message at lunch with a review of my morning, prompting me to realign for the afternoon. On Saturdays, it generates my weekly review, asking me to reflect on what worked and what didn't. It helps me see the patterns I’m blind to—the subtle drifts away from my goals, the recurring "improvements" I keep logging, the mismatch between my intentions and my actions.

### The Philosophy: Freedom Through Systems

This isn't about creating a rigid, robotic existence. It’s about creating freedom. By automating the documentation and review processes, I’m freeing up my cognitive energy to focus on what truly matters. By receiving objective, data-driven feedback, I’m gaining the clarity needed to make genuine change.

### A Personal Application of a Professional Vision

My professional ambition is to build sophisticated, self-improving AI agents that can automate complex roles in various industries. I see a future where AI systems, trained on local LLMs and refined through human-in-the-loop feedback, become invaluable partners in business. Neocortexa is the most intimate application of that vision. It’s a system designed to automate a single employee: me. It learns from my feedback, logs its mistakes, refines its own prompts, and continuously gets better at its one and only job—helping me become better.

Neocortexa is my attempt to dare greatly, to use the language of technology not just to build products, but to build a self. It's a living experiment in human-AI symbiosis, and I’m just getting started.
